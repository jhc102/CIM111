            My name is Joseph Chica and I am a classical pianist and composer. My journey has been one of trials and tribulations in route to where I am now. When I was six years old, I aspired to learn to play the beautiful instrument that sat collecting dust in my living room. I went to a local music studio where I was denied because they "didn't know how to teach someone like me". See I was born with a rare retinal degenerative disease called Lebers Congential Amaourosis or LCa for short, that causes progressive vision loss. As such, reading sheet music is obviously not possible. It wasn't until six years later that I was given the opportunity to sit at a piano and recieve my first real lesson. I quickly grew fond of the instrument and worked rigorously to show those that had doubted me that I was capable, and to inspire others in similar situations to percerviere. Today I am a accomplished musician who has recieved recognition from local and national musicians. I have been featured as a top musician in the state of Florida, and am currently studying music at the distinguished Frost School of Music at the University of Miami. My goal is to continue to inspire others to reach for their dreams no matter how impossible they may seem.
